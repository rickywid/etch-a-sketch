# Pixel Sketch using JQuery

## Overview
One of my first web projects using all the skills I've learned. I created a simple web app where user can select a colour and fill in the canvas by hovering over the space. The user can also choose to display different grid sizes (grid sizes > 20 seemed to crash the browser - haven't found a fix yet).
